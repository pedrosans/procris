# ![alt text](data/icon/procris.svg "Procris logo") Procris

Procris is a desktop environment plugin that adds tiling features from mainly dwm and Vim to the desktop environment of choice.

### Rationale

The daily work creating, organizing, navigating between windows and panes inside Vim and Tmux carry a common logic: the prefix key + command key and the prefix key + colon, to open the command prompt. The idea behind Procris is to bring this same logic to the rest of the windows being worked with, the ones in the DE itself, thus centralizing the feature "working with windows".

By doing so, Procris grabs two keys in the same way they are handled by Tmux and Vim: consuming them inside their processes; which is accomplished by both grabbing the first key at the root window event handling level and the second key at the Procris window event handling itself.

Besides the Vim/Tmux logic, a set of single keys are bound to windows tiling features in dwm to add the missing master/stack/layout features DE windows.

Being so, the project is an attempt to bring the most comfortable mappings and logic to work with windows inside (mainly) dwm and Vim to the desktop environment of choice in a standardized way.

### Usage

Commands are bound to names and keys inside Procris mappings
module. A command can be called from both a bound key or from the colon prompt.

Keys can be simple or combined.
Simple key straight cause the bound command to be called.
Combined keys are composed of a
[prefix key](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/tmux/tmux.1.en.html#KEY_BINDINGS)
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> by default) followed by a
[command key](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/tmux/tmux.1.en.html#KEY_BINDINGS).
The prefix key starts a reading and waits for a command key or a colon key.
By default, command keys are mapped to commands to change window focus, position, and state like 
[CTRL-W commands](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#windows-intro)
or
[window commands](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/vimindex.html#CTRL-W)
in Vim.

### Reading

The prefix key causes Procris to start a reading, which is the process of to open a window
to capture the following key. The following key can both start the colon prompt
or, if a command key, to call a command.

While inside a reading,
commands can output messages which will be listed on top of the window.
The reading will continue until a command is successfully called and returned
with no message. The window will remain visible while the reading is started.
This logic allows usages like to close a set of windows:

1. start a reading using the prefix key
2. list all windows in the workspace entering :buffers in the colon prompt
3. pass window numbers (as listed by :buffers) as parameters to :bdelete

### Layout

Procris default mappings are mainly dwm key bindings for commands to change the
layout function, increase/decrease the master area, promote/demote a window
up/down or to the top of the stack. By default, Procris uses 
[tiled](https://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial/) layout. The other 3 layouts:
floating, monocle, [centeredmaster](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/centeredmaster/)
can be chosen either by selecting their option on the status icon on the DE
panel or by calling their command via a bound key.
Each layout is visually indicated by a custom icon in the DE panel:

### Vim

Procris borrows Vim commands and keys to manipulate buffers. A buffer
means both an application and a window. So the bellow commands will:

`:ls` lists current windows.

`:b4` change the focus to the window number 4.

`:buffer term` brings the focus to the window containing `term` in the title if any.

`:bd` closes the current window.

`:edit calc` launch an application containing `calc` in the name like a calculator app.

### Customization

#### Mappings

A custom mappings module can be provided by placing its definition in `~/.config/procris/mappings.py`.
In the case of a custom module, it will be loaded instead of the default one. The default one at
[procris/mappings.py](procris/config.py) is meant to be a starting point.

#### Interface

Configuration file is located at `~/.config/procris/procris.cfg` and enables:

Section `[interface]` | Customization options
-|-
`list_workspaces`| if buffers command should list windows from all workspaces. Default is `true`
`position`| `top`, `middle`, `bottom`. Default is `bottom`
`width`| interface width in pixels or `100%` if it should span the entire screen. Default is 800
`auto_hint` | show hints for the command as it is being typed. Default is `true`
`auto_select_first_hint` | if the fist option offered in the hint bar should be selected automatically. Default is `true`

`procris.cfg` example:

```
[interface]
auto_hint = true
position = middle
width = 100%
```

The style can be customized by placing a custom css at `~/.config/procris/procris.css`.
The default CSS in the module [view](procris/view.py) is meant to be used as a reference.
A possible customization example is:

```css
* {
	font-size: 14pt;
}
```

### Key grabbing

All simple key and prefix key are
[passively grabbed](https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/GrabProcessing/)
by the display root window,
so the key won't be sent to the active window and cause side effects.
Meanwhile, command keys are consumed by Procris's window inside a reading,
which is opened and focused every time the prefix key is issued.
For this reason, the prefix key must be mapped to `reading.start` command.

### Terminology

While 'colon prompt' and 'prefix key' are terms from 
[GNU screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/html_node/Commands.html)
and
[tmux](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/tmux/tmux.1.en.html#KEY_BINDINGS),
similar pieces are referred to as 'command prompt' and 'termwinkey'
by also tmux and [Vim](https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27termwinkey%27)
documentation. They share the same logic and are referred to as
'colon prompt' and 'prefix key' inside Procris documentation and source code.
